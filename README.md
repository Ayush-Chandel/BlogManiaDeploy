# BlogMania - A Blog/Article Website

## Technologies Used

    
   * React : Powered the dynamic user experience. Component-based architecture made the codebase modular, reusable, and scalable. Perfect for managing complex UIs and real-time updates.

   * Redux : Handled global state like a charm. From user authentication to API data handling — Redux made state management predictable and organized across the app.

   * Tailwind CSS : Used for rapid UI development. Utility-first classes helped me build responsive and beautiful components with minimal CSS bloat. The design is sleek, consistent, and mobile-friendly out of the box!

   * Firebase : Handled all backend needs — user authentication, real-time Firestore updates.

   * React Hook Form : Made form handling a breeze — from user login to post creation. One of the key features is automatic slug generation from post title.

   * React Router : Enabled smooth, single-page navigation across different pages. Users can explore without page reloads — enhancing the browsing experience.

   * TinyMCE Editor : Integrated as a rich text editor to give authors a seamless WYSIWYG writing experience with full formatting and media support.

   * HTML React Parser : Converted the HTML content from TinyMCE into safe, React-friendly elements — allowing dynamic rendering of blog posts directly within the app.

   * Supabase : Used Supabase Storage to manage and serve images efficiently and ensuring fast, scalable asset delivery.”
